# 🥕 Good Food Purchasing Analytics & Dashboard

Government Food Purchasing Trends Across Agencies

# 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes Good Food Purchasing Data from U.S. city agencies to uncover insights into public food spending, vendor behavior, pricing trends, and sustainability indicators.
The analysis is complemented by an interactive dashboard that enables data-driven and sustainable food procurement decisions.

# 📁 Dataset

Source: U.S. Government Open Data Portal

Dataset: Good Food Purchasing Data

Key attributes include:

Product name, category, and group

Quantity purchased and total cost

Vendors and city agencies

Unit price, product origin, and time period

# 🎯 Project Objectives

Analyze food spending distribution across categories

Compare average unit prices across city agencies

Identify top vendors and food items by cost and quantity

Track year-over-year trends in fruit and vegetable purchases

Detect price fluctuations in frequently purchased items

Classify food into whole vs. processed categories

Explore vendor diversification across product groups

# 🧼 Data Cleaning & Preparation

To ensure accurate analysis:

Handled missing values and inconsistent entries

Standardized date formats and created a Year feature

Removed duplicate vendor and product records

Classified food items into whole and processed categories

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analysis techniques included:

Category-wise and vendor-wise aggregations

Time-series trend analysis

Price variation and outlier detection

Correlation analysis of numerical features

Visual exploration using bar charts, heatmaps, and boxplots

📈 Dashboard Features

Interactive filters and slicers for agencies, vendors, and categories

Visual breakdown of spending patterns and pricing trends

Insights on sustainability and cost efficiency

Decision-support views for policy makers and procurement teams

# 🔍 Key Insights

Food spending is concentrated in a few major categories such as grains and dairy

Significant unit price variation exists across agencies for identical items

A small number of vendors account for a large share of total spend

Fruit and vegetable purchases show year-over-year fluctuations

Processed foods contribute a notable portion of total expenditure despite higher whole-food purchases

Vendor specialization is common, with limited diversification

# 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Data Processing: Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, EDA
